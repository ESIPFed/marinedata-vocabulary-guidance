## How to Contribute

These guidance documents are an effort by the ESIP marine data cluster to provide insight to members of the earth science community around the use of controlled vocabularies.  Rather than acting as an authority, the cluster's goals are to foster discussion, sharing of experiences, and provide a forum for discussing best practices among the community.  Contributions can be made in the following ways:

- For new proposals and discussion topics start a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ESIPFed/marinedata-vocabulary-guidance/issues)
- Contribute to the codebase with a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ESIPFed/marinedata-vocabulary-guidance/pulls)
- Join the discussion at one of the [marine data cluster calls](https://wiki.esipfed.org/MarineData) or join the [mailing list](https://lists.esipfed.org/mailman/listinfo/esip-marinedata)

## Guidelines for Contributing

All contributors are expected to abide by the [ESIP community guidelines](https://www.esipfed.org/about/community-guidelines).
