# marinedata-vocabulary-guidance
As an interim solution to vocabulary harmonization, this repository will develop guidance for data managers on how to select an appropriate vocabulary for their oceanographic observations.

This repository is intended to provide insights from the experiences of the community along with explanations in accessible language. 

A general overview is described in [overview.md](overview.md)

Please contribute your knowledge! Comments, edits, and suggestions are welcome via pull request, new issue, or by email to esip-marinedata-owner@lists.esipfed.org

This guidance document has been created by ESIP's Marine Data Cluster.

Meetings on the 2nd Thursday of the month at 10:30 PT / 1:30 ET. For more information see [wiki.esipfed.org/MarineData](https://wiki.esipfed.org/MarineData)
