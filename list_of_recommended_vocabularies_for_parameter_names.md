====================================================

## Chemistry, Physical

### CF Standard Names

https://cfconventions.org/

The CF standard names list is maintained by the CF governance group here:
https://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html

New names can be suggested via the github repository. New terms undergo rigorous inspection and discussion before approval.


#### CF Standard Names Strengths

- Strong community support

#### CF Standard Names Limitations

- Slow pace and effort of suggesting new terms (subjective)

### Chemistry, Physical General Commentary

## Biology

### Worms

https://www.marinespecies.org/index.php

The World Register of Marine Species is an authoritative classification and catalogue of marine names.

#### Strengths

- Marine specific
- Incredibly responsive team

#### Limitations

- Potental conflicts (invite to comment)

### Itis

https://www.itis.gov/

The Integrated Taxonomic Information System. Authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North America and the world.

#### Strengths

- Taxonomic Serial Number

#### Limitations

- Not marine specific (invite to comment)

### NCBI Taxonomy

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy

The Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases. This currently represents about 10% of the described species of life on the planet.

#### Strengths

- Taxids

#### Limitations

- Genomics oriented (invite to comment)

### Biology Commentary

- OBIS and Darwincore: Many programs request biological data be submitted to OBIS, which requires use of the DarwinCore format, which requires use of WoRMS in combination with NVS. OBIS is a fantastic data aggregator but it should be noted that data can be used outside the OBIS framework. (invite to comment)
